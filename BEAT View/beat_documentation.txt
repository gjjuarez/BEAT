The development and Engineering Command recognize the complexity and the time it takes to perform binary analysis. They want a system that would allow their analysis to reduce the amount of time required to perform a more targeted type of binary analysis via a graphical user interface. The University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) and Development and Engineering Command are collaborating to develop a Behavior Extraction and Analysis Tool (BEAT) that will provide the ability to conduct binary analysis intercept and the ability to modify contents of network packets via a graphical user interface.
